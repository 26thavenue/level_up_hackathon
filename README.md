## Level Up Front End Hackathon
The Hackathon challenge is a Figma design that you have to bring to life as a frontend engineer. The Figma design is an exact replica of the Shopify onboarding dashboard. This is the dashboard that is used by Shopify's 1.75 million merchants to sell millions in ecommerce products.

## Your Challenge
Your challenge is to build the merchant onboarding experience as per the Figma design we'll provide to you. You are to cater for the three most popular types of Shopify merchants:

1.Mouse users
2.Keyboard-only users
3.Screen reader users

You are to create a fully responsive experience for users on these device types:
1.Mobile Phones (Google Chrome Browser Only)
2.Desktops (Google Chrome Browser Only)

To complete this challenge, assume you are a software engineer at Shopify, assigned to complete this project, so as to provide a great dashboard experience to Shopify merchants.
